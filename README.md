Tinder
======
[Watch it in action here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm1juOhxxh8)
Cloning the swipe left/right interaction in the Tinder app.

Note: in the "expt" branch there is only one card to swipe right/left
and the card reappears in a nice springy fashion with a different image. 

//Mainly used UIKitDynamics.
